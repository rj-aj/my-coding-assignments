 Create a database called 'my_first_db' .
    use my_first_db;

Create students collections.
db.createCollection("students")

Each document you insert into this collection should have the following format: ({name: STRING, 
home_state: STRING, lucky_number: NUMBER, birthday: {month: NUMBER, day: NUMBER, year: NUMBER}})
Create 5 students with the appropriate info.

db.students.insert({name: "Reena", home_state: "WA", lucky_number: 10, birthday: {month: 10, day: 10, year: 2001}})
db.students.insert({name: "Alok", home_state: "WA", lucky_number: 11, birthday: {month: 11, day: 11, year: 2011}})
db.students.insert({name: "Anu",  home_state: "CA", lucky_number: 12, birthday: {month: 12, day: 12, year : 2012}})
db.students.insert({name: "Niki", home_state: "CA", lucky_number: 09, birthday : {month: 09, day: 09, year : 2009}})
db.students.insert({name : "Parul", home_state: "CA", lucky_number: 05, birthday: {month: 05, day: 05, year: 2005}})

Get all students
db.students.find({}).pretty()

Retrieve all students who are from California (San Jose Dojo) or Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.find({home_state:"CA"}).pretty()
db.students.find({home_state:"WA"}).pretty()

Get all students whose lucky number is: greater than 3
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$gt:3}})

Get all students whose lucky number is: less than or equal to 10
db.students.find({lucky_number: {$lte:10}})

Get all students whose lucky number is: between 1 and 9 (inclusive)
db.students.find({lucky_number:{$gte:1, $lte:9}})

Add a field to each student collection called 'interests' that is an ARRAY.  It should contain the following 
entries: 'coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB'. Do this in ONE operation.

db.students.update({}, {$set: {interests:['coding', 'brunch', 'MongoDB']}}, {multi:true}})

Add some unique interests for each particular student into each of their interest arrays.
db.students.update({name:"Niki"},{$push: {interests: "reading"}})

db.students.update({name:"Reena"},{$push:{interests: {$each:["cooking", "hiking"]} }})

Add the interest 'taxes' into someone's interest array.
db.students.update({name:"Alok"}, {$push: {interests:"taxes"}})

Remove the 'taxes' interest you just added.
db.students.update( { name:"Alok" }, { $pop: { interests:"taxes" } } )

Remove all students who are from California (or Washington).
db.students.remove({home_state:"CA"})

Remove a student by name. 
db.students.remove({name:"Reena"})

Remove a student whose lucky number is greater than 5 (JUST ONE)
db.students.remove({lucky_number: {$gt:5}}, {justOne:true})

Add a field in each student collection called 'number_of_belts' and set it to 0.
db.students.update({},{$set: {"number_of_belts":0}},{multi:true})

Increment this field by 1 for all students in Washington (Seattle Dojo).
db.students.update({home_state:"WA"}, {$inc: {number_of_belts:1}}, {multi:true})

Rename the 'number_of_belts' field to 'belts_earned'
db.students.update({}, {$rename: {"number_of_belts":"belts_earned"}}, {multi:true})

Remove the lucky_number field
db.students.update({}, {$unset: {lucky_number:""}}, {multi:true})

Add a 'updated_on' field, and set the value as the current date.
db.students.update({},{$currentDate: {updated_on: true}}, {multi: true})
